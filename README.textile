h1. Walkthrough app

This small application is designed to introduce a beginner to several features of active scaffold.  Each commit is very descriptive and precise to show what code was changed to perform certain actions along the way.

Features demonstrated:
* Image uploading / thumbnails
* File uplaoding
* Calendar pickers
* Nested scaffolds
* Column overrides
* Creating a drag-drop sortable list

To start:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold_walkthrough.git
cd active_scaffold_walkthrough
git submodule init && git submodule update
rake db:migrate

# start iterating through commits
./walkthrough.sh next

# see details about the current commit (diff)
./walkthrough.sh show

# keep iterating
./walkthrough.sh next
./walkthrough.sh prev

# stop
./walkthrough.sh abort
</pre>
